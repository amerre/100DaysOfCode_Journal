    <h1>About this challenge</h1>
    <p>
      This challenge is very simple, it consists of
      <b>coding at least an hour a day for 100 days</b> in a row. In parallel, the rule requires to post a tweet every day to indicate the work done and to keep track. I slightly modified this point, I will publish every day my progress on this small site to keep track of the entirety of my work without relying on Twitter. I will still publish my site from time to time to have feedback and reviews on what I do.
